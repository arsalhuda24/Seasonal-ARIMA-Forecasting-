# Seasonal-ARIMA-Forecasting-

An important concept in time series is stationarity which states that properties of time series do not depend at the time at which the series was observed. Any time series which has a specific trend and seasonality is termed as non-stationary. Therefore it is an essential practice to make a time series stationary by removing trend and seasonality and we usually do this by differencing the time series i-e by subtracting the lagged version of ts from original series. Transformation of time series also helps to reduce the variance. 
ARIMA stands for Auto regressive moving integrated average. It is basically an ensemble of AR and MA processes
